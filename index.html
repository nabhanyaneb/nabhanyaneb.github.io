Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

  <p>I am incredibly dedicated to success in the technological industry. I've been taking Computer Science courses since my freshman year of high school, and I'm graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science from Rutgers University in January 2022. Visit my <a href="about.html" target="_blank"><u> About Me</u></a> page to learn more about my technical skills.</p>
  <p>I have always been mathematically inclined, and I'm exploring my interest by pursuing a minor in Mathematics. I've discovered realms of Mathematics that I never knew existed, and I hope to start a career that combines Mathematics and Computer Science.</p> 
  <p> When I was little, I was very shy and quiet. I turned to books as my escape because it was comforting getting involed in a world of characters where I did not have to say or do anything, I could just observe. Though I have outgrown my shyness and turned into someone who is quite the opposite, I am still socially introverted, and reading is a hobby I can enjoy alone and relieve any stress I have. My favorite reads are <i>East of Eden</i>, <i>A Northern Light</i>, and <i>The Housekeeper and the Professor</i>.</p>
  <p>I've been dancing since the age of 5. I've experimented with many different styles of dance, including Ballet, Lyrical, Jazz, Contemporary, Modern, Hip Hop, and even a little bit of Tap. Although I enjoy them all, my one true love is Lyrical. Lyrical taught me how to tell a story through a series of movements. From the simple reaches to the tricks and stunts, I've learned how to bring my fire to my motions.
